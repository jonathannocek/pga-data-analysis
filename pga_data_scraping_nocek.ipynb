The Strokes Gained concept can confusing so [here](https://www.pgatour.com/news/2016/05/31/strokes-gained-defined.html) is a detailed explanation of the statistic. It has revolutionized golf statistics and has provided significant insight as to how a player analyzes their game. \n",
        "\n",
        "The Strokes Gained - concept is a by-product of the PGA TOUR's ShotLink Intelligence Program, which encourages academics to perform research against ShotLink statistical data. Professor Mark Broadie from Columbia Business School developed the early concept which was later refined by the TOUR.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **NAME** - The name of the golfer\n",
        "*   **ROUNDS** - The number of rounds played in the given season\n",
        "*   **SCORING** - The weighted scoring average which takes the stroke average of the field into account. It is computed by adding a player's total strokes to an adjustment and dividing by the total rounds played. The adjustment is computed by determining the stroke average of the field for each round played. This average is subtracted from par to create an adjustment for each round. A player accumulates these adjustments for each round played.\n",
        "*   **DRIVE_DISTANCE** - The average number of yards per measured drive. These drives are measured on two holes per round. Care is taken to select two holes which face in opposite directions to counteract the effect of wind. Drives are measured to the point at which they come to rest regardless of whether they are in the fairway or not \n",
        "*   **FWY_%** - The percentage of time a tee shot comes to rest in the fairway (regardless of club).\n",
        "*   **GIR_%** - The percent of time a player was able to hit the green in regulation (greens hit in regulation/holes played). Note: A green is considered hit in regulation if any portion of the ball is touching the putting surface after the GIR stroke has been taken. (The GIR stroke is determined by subtracting 2 from par (1st stroke on a par 3, 2nd on a par 4, 3rd on a par 5))\n",

The sum of the values for all holes played in a round minus the field average strokes gained/lost for the round is the player's Strokes gained/lost for that round. The sum of strokes gained for each round are divided by total rounds played. \n",
        "*   **SG_ATG (Strokes Gained Around the Green)** - The number of Around the Green strokes a player takes from specific locations and distances are measured against a statistical baseline to determine the player's strokes gained or lost on a hole. \n",
        "*   **SG_APP (Strokes Gained Approach)** - The number of Approach the Green strokes a player takes from specific locations and distances are measured against a statistical baseline to determine the player's strokes gained or lost on a hole. \n",
        "*   **SG_OTT (Strokes Gained Off the Tee)** - The number of strokes a player takes from a specific distance off the tee on Par 4 & par 5's is measured against a statistical baseline to determine the player's strokes gained or lost off the tee on a hole. \n",
        "*   **SG_TTG (Strokes Gained Tee to Green)** - The per round average of the number of Strokes the player was better or worse than the field average on the same course & event minus the Players Strokes Gained putting value. \n",

        "*   **PAR3 (Par 3 Scoring)** - The average score on all par 3's played (e.g. 3.22)\n",
        "*   **PAR4 (Par 4 Scoring)** - The average score on all par 4's played (e.g. 4.22)\n",
        "*   **PAR5 (Par 5 Scoring)** - The average score on all par 5's played (e.g. 5.22)\n",
        "*   **POINTS** - Total number of FedEx Cup points\n",
        "*   **TOP 10** - The number of top 10 finishes\n",
        "*   **1ST** - The number of tournaments won\n",
        "*   **YEAR** - The year of the season for the statistics\n",
        "*   **UD_%** - A subjective stat.  Most college programs define it as a short shot (i.e. a pitch or chip shot) and the percentage of time that they get the ball up and down, or a chip and a putt.\n",
        "*   **SS_%** - The percent of time a player was able to get 'up and down' once in a greenside sand bunker (regardless of score). Note: 'Up and down' indicates it took the player 2 shots or less to put the ball in the hole from that point.\n",
        "*   **SCRAM_%** - The percent of time a player misses the green in regulation, but still makes par or better. \n",
        "*   **PUTTS** - The average number of putts taken during a round.\n",
